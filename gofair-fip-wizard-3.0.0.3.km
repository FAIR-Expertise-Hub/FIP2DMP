FAIR Implementation Profile (FIP) is a list of declared technology choices intended to implement each of the FAIR Guiding Principles, made as a collective decision by the members of a particular community of practice. As can be seen herein, the FIP Wizard captures FIPs by means of a questionnaire that prompts a representative of the community (the Community Data Steward) to provide answers that explicitly profile the FAIR implementation approach of that community. FIPs are published by the FIP Wizard as FAIR (machine-readable) and Open data, which can then serve as a reference for practical FAIR data stewardship activities conducted by members of that community. FIP publication also encourages FIP reuse and repurposing by other communities, which saves time ‘reinventing the wheel’ and simultaneously drives convergence on FAIR implementation choices. Over time, FIPs need to be revised to reflect the evolving needs of the community and the ongoing development of FAIR technologies. The FIP Wizard supports versioning for systematic revisioning, which in turn can provide insight into FAIR-related technology trends. In short, the growing pool of machine-readable community inspired FIPs can help to make FAIRification efforts more structured, better informed and overall more efficient. \n\nDetailed instructions for completing the FIP Wizard questionnaire can be found here: gofairfoundation.org/FIP Wizard manual \n\nBrief explanations are given herein, per question, based on Jacobsen etal FAIR Principles: Interpretations and Implementation Considerations. Data Intelligence 2020; 2 (1-2): 10–29. doi: https://doi.org/10.1162/dint_r_00024\n\nFIP Wizard team is composed of Barbara Magagna, Marek Suchanek, and Erik Schultes. We wish you success in composing your FIP. If you have any comments, questions or suggestions on how to improve the FIP Wizard experience, please contact us at fipwizard@gofairfoundation.org\n\nFor further reading: \nReusable FAIR Implementation Profiles as Accelerators of FAIR Convergence.

These collective decisions compose the FAIR Implementation Profile (FIP), and are made on behalf of that community of practice. \n\nA FAIR Implementation Community (FIC) is defined as a voluntary association of people and organisations that agree to adhere to the same FIP. Note, the FAIR Implementation Community can be large or small, formal or informal. It is anticipated that FIPs will likely evolve (merge, split) over time as they are designed, tested and repurposed by other FICs. In any case, the FIC is fundamentally important to FAIR and defining the FIC is the beginning of any FAIRification effort. \n\nIn this section of the FIP Wizard, you, the Community Data Steward, are requested to answer questions that will declare, in a machine-readable way, the FAIR Implementation Community.","title":"Declare your FAIR Implementation Community","uuid":"a6918d50-27be-4430-8f02-95bd8c14fc86"},{"annotations":[{"key":"nanopub.var.reply","value":"community"}],"createdAt":"2022-01-10T07:16:19.811713Z","entityUuid":"cdaa64a5-f0a9-407e-a05e-9c9c58fd8387","eventType":"AddQuestionEvent","integrationUuid":"c08c6142-6f69-4ffa-b968-e5d5c240f6ae","parentUuid":"c1248b82-0538-4780-a0b4-983f632b1615","props":{"type":"https://w3id.org/fair/fip/terms/FAIR-Implementation-Community"},"questionType":"IntegrationQuestion","requiredPhaseUuid":"c69313c7-db3f-4742-ba6c-62eb679c2eb0","tagUuids":[],"text":"In the drop-down list, select your FAIR Implementation Community.

principle F1 enables unambiguous identification of resources of interest, principle F2 speaks to the ability to discover a resource of interest through, for example, search or filtering. Simply stated, a digital resource that is not well-described cannot be easily discovered. Digital resources should therefore be described with rich metadata – including descriptors of the content of the resource referred to by that identifier. It is hard to generally define the minimally required “richness” of this metadata, except that the more generous and comprehensive it is, both for humans and computers, the more findable (in a meaningful way) it becomes in refined searches. While other principles specify metadata elements that must be present to support, for example, specific aspects of reusability (e.g. citation and license) principle F2 is primarily about discovery. Thus, this principle encourages data providers and domain experts to consider the various facets of search that might be employed by a user of their data, and to support those users in their discovery of the resource. To enable both global and local search engines to locate a resource, generic and domain-specific descriptors should be provided, that can be exposed to indexing by the relevant search facilities.","title":"Declaration F2: What metadata schemas do you use for findability?","uuid":"1750a85a-4674-4577-8381-3d4373f74be0"},{"advice":null,"annotations":[{"key":"nanopub.before","value":"#

F3 implies that the digital object (data, metadata, software or any other) has metadata that is separated from the actual object they describe, but are nonetheless persistently linked via a GUPRI (linking metadata explicitly to the digital object and vice versa). In this question, we are looking for the technology that permanently links your data and metadata. The answers could range from metadata schema having predicates that qualify the relations and locations to the mechanisms that repositories and FAIR Data Points use to guarantee the permalink. In general if persistent identifiers are assigned they should be findable in the metadata as a separate field. For instance, the metadata description of a computational workflow should explicitly contain the identifier for that workflow in a manner that is unambiguous. Many digital objects (such as workflows) have well-defined structures that may disallow the addition of new fields, including fields that could point to the metadata about that digital object. Therefore, the only consistent way for both humans and machines to discover its metadata is through a search for the identifier of that digital object. Thus, by requiring that a metadata descriptor contains the identifier of the thing being described, that identifier may then successfully be used as the search term to discover its metadata record.","title":"Declaration F3: What is the technology that links the persistent identifiers of your data to the metadata

is a continued focus on keeping relevant digital resources available in the future. Data may no longer be accessible either by design (e.g. a defined lifespan within limited financial resources or legal requirements to destroy sensitive data) or by accident. However, given that those data may have been used and are referenced by others, it is important that data consumers have, at the very least, access to high quality metadata that describes those resources sufficiently to minimally understand their nature and their provenance, even when the relevant data are not available anymore. Hence, Principle A2 asks for definitive “Tomb Stone” metadata when necessary. This principle relies heavily on the “second purpose” of principle F3 (the metadata record contains the identifier of the data), because in the case where the data record is no longer available, there must be a clear and precise way of discovering its historical metadata record. A2 is often associated with a metadata longevity plan that will be, in most cases, hard to locate even if it exists since such a plan is far from standardized. An excellent challenge to the community at large is to create a standard, machine-readable metadata longevity plan and predicates to identify it as such. In the meantime, your community can author a minimal machine-readable metadata longevity plan as a nanopublication and link to it from the FIP Wizard.

I2 requests controlled (registered) vocabularies are used to refer to the concepts that exist in a given domain. The use of shared, and formally structured sets of terms is an essential part of FAIR (I1). Terminology systems, including flat “vocabularies”, hierarchical “thesauri” (e.g., SKOS) and more granular specifications of knowledge such as data models and ontologies (e.g., OWL), play an important role in community standards.

resources and their metadata must always, without exception, include a license that describes under which conditions the resource can be used, even if that condition is “unconditional”. By default, resources cannot be legally used without this clarity. Note also that a license that cannot be found by an agent, is effectively the same as no license at all. Furthermore, the license may be different for a data resource and the metadata that describes it, which has implications for the indexing of metadata v.v. findability. This is a clear public domain statement, an equivalent such as terms of use or computer protocol to digitally facilitate an operation (for instance a smart contract). Thus, the absence of a license does not indicate “open”, but rather creates legal uncertainty that will deter (in fact, in many cases legally prevent) reuse. Note also that the combination of resources with restrictive license conditions may lead to adverse effects, and ultimately preclude the use of the combined resources. In order to facilitate reuse, the license chosen should be as open as possible. Hence, Principle R1.1 is about legal interoperability. The conditions under which the data can be used should be clear to machines and humans. There are many considerations that go into the conditions of reuse and the choice of licensing. For guidance, Creative Commons is a good place to start (https://chooser-beta.creativecommons.org/) and the Software Package Data Exchange offers an extensive listing of other licenses

resources and their metadata must always, without exception, include a license that describes under which conditions the resource can be used, even if that condition is “unconditional”. By default, resources cannot be legally used without this clarity. Note also that a license that cannot be found by an agent, is effectively the same as no license at all. Furthermore, the license may be different for a data resource and the metadata that describes it, which has implications for the indexing of metadata v.v. findability. This is a clear public domain statement, an equivalent such as terms of use or computer protocol to digitally facilitate an operation (for instance a smart contract). Thus, the absence of a license does not indicate “open”, but rather creates legal uncertainty that will deter (in fact, in many cases legally prevent) reuse. Note also that the combination of resources with restrictive license conditions may lead to adverse effects, and ultimately preclude the use of the combined resources. In order to facilitate reuse, the license chosen should be as open as possible. Hence, Principle R1.1 is about legal interoperability. The conditions under which the data can be used should be clear to machines and humans. There are many considerations that go into the conditions of reuse and the choice of licensing. For guidance, Creative Commons is a good place to start (https://chooser-beta.creativecommons.org/) and the Software Package Data Exchange offers an extensive listing of other licenses

Note: metadata schema, vocabularies and even metadata instances will also have, if they adhere to the FAIR Principles, associated metadata descriptions. Hence, this question is asking for metadata that describes the provenance of the metadata.","title":"Declaration R1.2 Datasets: Which metadata schemas do you use for describing the provenance of your

The use of shared, and formally structured sets of terms is an essential part of FAIR (I1). Terminology systems, including flat “vocabularies”, hierarchical “thesauri” (e.g., SKOS) and more granular specifications of knowledge such as data models and ontologies (e.g., OWL), play an important role in community standards. However, the vocabularies used for metadata or data also need to be findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable in their own right so that users (including machines) can access and fully understand the semantics of the terms used in the metadata. I2 is thus recursive in that both enables, and requires FAIR implementation. This recursive “circularity” has sometimes caused confusion but the simple use of a “label” (e.g. “temperature”) is insufficient to enable a machine to understand both the intent of that label (Body temperature? Melting temperature?) and the contexts within which it can be properly linked – same-with-same – to other similarly-labelled data. I2, therefore, requires that the vocabulary terms used in the knowledge representation language (Principle I1) can be sufficiently distinguished, by a machine, to ensure detection of “false agreements” as well as “false disagreements”. See also Ten simple rules for making a vocabulary FAIR, PLoS Comput Biol 17(6): e1009041. [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009041).

By default, resources cannot be legally used without this clarity. Note also that a license that cannot be found by an agent, is effectively the same as no license at all. Furthermore, the license may be different for a data resource and the metadata that describes it, which has implications for the indexing of metadata v.v. findability. This is a clear public domain statement, an equivalent such as terms of use or computer protocol to digitally facilitate an operation (for instance a smart contract). Thus, the absence of a license does not indicate “open”, but rather creates legal uncertainty that will deter (in fact, in many cases legally prevent) reuse. Note also that the combination of resources with restrictive license conditions may lead to adverse effects, and ultimately preclude the use of the combined resources. In order to facilitate reuse, the license chosen should be as open as possible. Hence, Principle R1.1 is about legal interoperability. The conditions under which the data can be used should be clear to machines and humans. There are many considerations that go into the conditions of reuse and the choice of licensing.

FAIR Implementation Profile (FIP) is a list of **declared** technology choices intended to implement each of the FAIR Guiding Principles, made as a collective decision by the members of a particular community of practice. As can be seen herein, the FIP Wizard captures FIPs by means of a questionnaire that prompts a representative of the community (the Community Data Steward) to provide answers that explicitly profile the FAIR implementation approach of that community. FIPs are published by the FIP Wizard as FAIR (machine-readable) and Open data, which can then serve as a reference for practical FAIR data stewardship activities conducted by members of that community. FIP publication also encourages FIP reuse and repurposing by other communities, which saves time ‘reinventing the wheel’ and simultaneously drives convergence on FAIR implementation choices.

Data may no longer be accessible either by design (e.g. a defined lifespan within limited financial resources or legal requirements to destroy sensitive data) or by accident. However, given that those data may have been used and are referenced by others, it is important that data consumers have, at the very least, access to high quality metadata that describes those resources sufficiently to minimally understand their nature and their provenance, even when the relevant data are not available anymore. Hence, Principle A2 asks for definitive “Tomb Stone” metadata when necessary. This principle relies heavily on the “second purpose” of principle F3 (the metadata record contains the identifier of the data), because in the case where the data record is no longer available, there must be a clear and precise way of discovering its historical metadata record. A2 is often associated with a metadata longevity plan that will be, in most cases, hard to locate even if it exists since such a plan is far from standardized. An excellent challenge to the community at large is to create a standard, machine-readable metadata longevity plan and predicates to identify it as such. In the meantime, your community can author a minimal machine-readable metadata longevity plan as a nanopublication and link to it from the FIP Wizard.

As can be seen herein, the FIP Wizard captures FIPs by means of a questionnaire that prompts a representative of the community (the Community Data Steward) to provide answers that explicitly profile the FAIR implementation approach of that community. FIPs are published by the FIP Wizard as FAIR (machine-readable) and Open data, which can then serve as a reference for practical FAIR data stewardship activities conducted by members of that community. FIP publication also encourages FIP reuse and repurposing by other communities, which saves time ‘reinventing the wheel’ and simultaneously drives convergence on FAIR implementation choices. Over time, FIPs need to be revised to reflect the evolving needs of the community and the ongoing development of FAIR technologies. The FIP Wizard supports versioning for systematic revisioning, which in turn can provide insight into FAIR-related technology trends. In short, the growing pool of machine-readable community inspired FIPs can help to make FAIRification efforts more structured, better informed and overall more efficient.\n\n*Detailed instructions for completing the FIP Wizard questionnaire can be found [here](https:gofairfoundation.org/FIP Wizard manual).  \nNote: The FIP Wizard makes use of a data format called nanopublications to capture FIPs as FAIR data. In some cases, it may be necessary to author original nanopublications to complete your FIP. The Wizard supports the creation of original nanopublications. You can access this feature in Chapter VII, “Register a new resource as a nanopublication”.* \n\nBrief explanations are given herein, per question, based on Jacobsen et al. FAIR Principles: Interpretations and Implementation Considerations. Data Intelligence 2020; 2 (1-2): 10–29. [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1162/dint_r_00024)\n\nFIP Wizard team is composed of Barbara Magagna, Marek Suchanek, and Erik Schultes. We wish you success in composing your FIP. If you have any comments, questions or suggestions on how to improve the FIP Wizard experience, please [contact us](mailto:fipwizard@gofairfoundation.org).\n\nThe FIP Wizard has its origin in the GO FAIR [FAIR Convergence Matrix (& FIP) Working Group](https://osf.io/n7uwp/), and development has been supported by the Center for Digital Scholarship at the Leiden University Libraries, CODATA, the ENVRI-FAIR project, the participation of numerous FAIR Implementation Communities, [(link)](https://osf.io/r2hzc/).\n\nFor further reading: \nReusable FAIR Implementation Profiles as Accelerators of FAIR Convergence.

The use of shared, and formally structured sets of terms is an essential part of FAIR (I1). Terminology systems, including flat “vocabularies”, hierarchical “thesauri” (e.g., SKOS) and more granular specifications of knowledge such as data models and ontologies (e.g., OWL), play an important role in community standards. However, the vocabularies used for metadata or data also need to be findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable in their own right so that users (including machines) can access and fully understand the semantics of the terms used in the metadata. I2 is thus recursive in that both enables, and requires FAIR implementation. This recursive “circularity” has sometimes caused confusion but the simple use of a “label” (e.g. “temperature”) is insufficient to enable a machine to understand both the intent of that label (Body temperature? Melting temperature?) and the contexts within which it can be properly linked – same-with-same – to other similarly-labelled data. I2, therefore, requires that the vocabulary terms used in the knowledge representation language (Principle I1) can be sufficiently distinguished, by a machine, to ensure detection of “false agreements” as well as “false disagreements”.

Terminology systems, including flat “vocabularies”, hierarchical “thesauri” (e.g., SKOS) and more granular specifications of knowledge such as data models and ontologies (e.g., OWL), play an important role in community standards. However, the vocabularies used for metadata or data also need to be findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable in their own right so that users (including machines) can access and fully understand the semantics of the terms used in the metadata. I2 is thus recursive in that both enables, and requires FAIR implementation. This recursive “circularity” has sometimes caused confusion but the simple use of a “label” (e.g. “temperature”) is insufficient to enable a machine to understand both the intent of that label (Body temperature? Melting temperature?) and the contexts within which it can be properly linked – same-with-same – to other similarly-labelled data. I2, therefore, requires that the vocabulary terms used in the knowledge representation language (Principle I1) can be sufficiently distinguished, by a machine, to ensure detection of “false agreements” as well as “false disagreements”.

In this question, we are looking for the technology that permanently links your data and metadata. The answers could range from metadata schema having predicates that qualify the relations and locations to the mechanisms that repositories and FAIR Data Points use to guarantee the permalink. In general if persistent identifiers are assigned they should be findable in the metadata as a separate field. For instance, the metadata description of a computational workflow should explicitly contain the identifier for that workflow in a manner that is unambiguous. Many digital objects (such as workflows) have well-defined structures that may disallow the addition of new fields, including fields that could point to the metadata about that digital object. Therefore, the only consistent way for both humans and machines to discover its metadata is through a search for the identifier of that digital object. Thus, by requiring that a metadata descriptor contains the identifier of the thing being described, that identifier may then successfully be used as the search term to discover its metadata record.

Other choices may also be acceptable, for instance when they are already in widespread use within a given community (such as XML or data format standards such as NetCDF) but in these cases, the community will have to also ensure there are mappings between their preferred format and a more widely used format such as RDF.

It is hard to generally define the minimally required “richness” of this metadata, except that the more generous and comprehensive it is, both for humans and computers, the more findable (in a meaningful way) it becomes in refined searches. While other principles specify metadata elements that must be present to support, for example, specific aspects of reusability (e.g. citation and license) principle F2 is primarily about discovery. Thus, this principle encourages data providers and domain experts to consider the various facets of search that might be employed by a user of their data, and to support those users in their discovery of the resource.

In this question, we are looking for the technology that permanently links your data and metadata. The answers could range from metadata schema having predicates that qualify the relations and locations to the mechanisms that repositories and FAIR Data Points use to guarantee the permalink. In general if persistent identifiers are assigned they should be findable in the metadata as a separate field. For instance, the metadata description of a computational workflow should explicitly contain the identifier for that workflow in a manner that is unambiguous. Many digital objects (such as workflows) have well-defined structures that may disallow the addition of new fields, including fields that could point to the metadata about that digital object. Therefore, the only consistent way for both humans and machines to discover its metadata is through a search for the identifier of that digital object.

Other choices may also be acceptable, for instance when they are already in widespread use within a given community (such as XML or data format standards such as NetCDF) but in these cases, the community will have to also ensure there are mappings between their preferred format and a more widely used format such as RDF. *Select below, a language system whereby knowledge can be made processable by machines.*"},"title":{"changed":false},"uuid":"47c2b858-e6a2-41d6-892a-df96435adc3c"},{"annotations":{"changed":false},"answerUuids":{"changed":false},"createdAt":"2022-01-19T22:36:00.764576Z","entityUuid":"c281570d-ef87-4520-b19f-eb3651908b4b","eventType":"EditQuestionEvent","expertUuids":{"changed":false},"parentUuid":"2b7ee188-a227-43a8-8bf9-a99e6aeb3939","questionType":"OptionsQuestion","referenceUuids":{"changed":false},"requiredPhaseUuid":{"changed":false},"tagUuids":{"changed":false},"text":{"changed":true,"value":"Principle I2 requests controlled (registered) vocabularies are used to refer to the concepts that exist in a given domain.

As can be seen herein, the FIP Wizard captures FIPs by means of a questionnaire that prompts a representative of the community (the Community Data Steward) to provide answers that explicitly profile the FAIR implementation approach of that community. FIPs are published by the FIP Wizard as FAIR (machine-readable) and Open data, which can then serve as a reference for practical FAIR data stewardship activities conducted by members of that community. FIP publication also encourages FIP reuse and repurposing by other communities, which saves time ‘reinventing the wheel’ and simultaneously drives convergence on FAIR implementation choices. Over time, FIPs need to be revised to reflect the evolving needs of the community and the ongoing development of FAIR technologies. The FIP Wizard supports versioning for systematic revisioning, which in turn can provide insight into FAIR-related technology trends. In short, the growing pool of machine-readable community inspired FIPs can help to make FAIRification efforts more structured, better informed and overall more efficient.\n\n*Detailed instructions for completing the FIP Wizard questionnaire can be found [here](https://osf.io/4bfcy/).  \nNote: The FIP Wizard makes use of a data format called nanopublications to capture FIPs as FAIR data. In some cases, it may be necessary to author original nanopublications to complete your FIP. The Wizard supports the creation of original nanopublications. You can access this feature in Chapter VII, “Register a new resource as a nanopublication”.* \n\nBrief explanations are given herein, per question, based on Jacobsen et al.

You will see that many of the FAIR Enabling Resources in the drop-down list are associated with a GO FAIR Foundation Qualification badge. GFF Qualified Resources have been assessed for their compliance with the preliminary Qualification Criteria of the GO FAIR Foundation (referenced in Chapter 1: About). If you do not find the FAIR Enabling Resources you are looking for in the drop-down list, it will be necessary to register that Resource as a nanopublication.

It is hard to generally define the minimally required “richness” of this metadata, except that the more generous and comprehensive it is, both for humans and computers, the more findable (in a meaningful way) it becomes in refined searches. While other principles specify metadata elements that must be present to support, for example, specific aspects of reusability (e.g. citation and license) principle F2 is primarily about discovery. Thus, this principle encourages data providers and domain experts to consider the various facets of search that might be employed by a user of their data, and to support those users in their discovery of the resource.

FAIR Implementation Profile (FIP) is a list of declared technology choices intended to implement each of the FAIR Guiding Principles, made as a collective decision by the members of a particular community of practice. As can be seen herein, the FIP Wizard captures FIPs by means of a questionnaire that prompts a representative of the community (the Community Data Steward) to provide answers that explicitly profile the FAIR implementation approach of that community. FIPs are published by the FIP Wizard as FAIR (machine-readable) and Open data, which can then serve as a reference for practical FAIR data stewardship activities conducted by members of that community. FIP publication also encourages FIP reuse and repurposing by other communities, which saves time ‘reinventing the wheel’ and simultaneously drives convergence on FAIR implementation choices. Over time, FIPs will need to be revised to reflect the evolving needs of the community and the ongoing development of FAIR technologies. In short, the FIP Wizard helps to make FAIRification efforts more structured, better informed and overall more efficient.\n\nThe FIP Wizard has a number of features specifically supporting FIP creation: \n\n**Questionnaire**: The FIP questionnaire is augmented with explanations, per question, based on Jacobsen et al. FAIR Principles: Interpretations and Implementation Considerations. Data Intelligence 2020; 2 (1-2): 10–29, [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1162/dint_r_00024) and referencable at the [GO FAIR Foundation website](https://www.gofair.foundation/interpretation )\n\n**Navigation**: While creating the FIP, the questionnaire can be navigated using the navigation tool on the left side of the page. \n\n**Versioning**: The FIP Wizard has versioning that allows systematic revisions of completed FIPs over time which in turn can provide insight into FAIR-related technology trends. \n\n**Nanopublications**: The FIP Wizard makes use of a data format called nanopublications to capture FIPs as FAIR data (in this case, as FAIR Digital Objects). In some cases, it may be necessary to author original nanopublications to complete your FIP.  The FIP Wizard supports the creation of original nanopublications in Chapter VII, “Register a new resource as a nanopublication”.\n\nDetailed instructions for completing the FIP Wizard questionnaire can be found [here](https://osf.io/4bfcy/).\n\nFIP Wizard team is composed of Barbara Magagna, Marek Suchanek, Tobias Kuhn, and Erik Schultes. We would like to acknowledge the generous support of CODATA and ENVRI-FAIR. We wish you success in composing your FIP. If you have any comments, questions or suggestions on how to improve the FIP Wizard experience, [contact us](mailto:barbara@gofair.foundation).\n\nThe FIP Wizard has its origin in the [GO FAIR FAIR Convergence Matrix (& FIP) Working Group](https://osf.io/n7uwp/) and development has been supported by the Center for Digital Scholarship at the Leiden University Libraries, CODATA, the ENVRI-FAIR project, the enthusiastic participation of numerous FAIR Implementation Communities, [see](https://osf.io/r2hzc/).\n\nFor further reading: Reusable FAIR Implementation Profiles as Accelerators of FAIR Convergence.

Digital resources must be described with rich metadata – including descriptors of the content of the resource referred to by that identifier. It is hard to generally define the minimally required “richness” of this metadata, except that the more generous and comprehensive it is, both for humans and computers, the more specifically findable (in a meaningful way) it becomes in refined searches. Descriptive metadata are, therefore, extremely important in cross-domain search and interdisciplinary use cases [see for example, OAIS, ISO 14721:2012; Lee, 2010]. For centuries, it has been common practice in the scholarly community to clearly reference research results through citations. To enable findability, the metadata required for citations is the minimum requirement and a number of works have defined the required properties (creator, title, publication date, publisher, and identifier) in a variety of documents [Data Citation Synthesis Group, 2014, Ball & Duke, 2015; Mooney & Newton, 2012 and Fenner et al., 2019]. Other works defined additional core metadata requirements for data discovery which may serve as a guideline [Asmi et al., 2017, DataCite Metadata Working Group, 2019, Loscio et al., 2017 and Albertoni et al., 2020]. Community specific metadata requirements, for examples those created in Metadata for Machine (M4M) workshops, may include additional metadata properties. While other principles specify metadata elements that must be present to support, for example, specific aspects of reusability (e.g. citation and license), principle F2 is primarily about discovery - that a digital resource that is well-described can be easily discovered even when the resource is unknown to the agent performing the search. Thus, this principle encourages data providers and domain experts to consider the various facets of search that might be employed by a user of their data, and to support those users in their discovery of the resource. To enable both global and local search engines to locate a resource, generic and domain-specific descriptors should be provided, that can be exposed to indexing by the relevant search facilities.\n\nTo summarize, this question requests a FAIR Enabling Resource of type “metadata schema” which is a specification (schema) that defines metadata fields describing attributes of data or other digital objects.\n"},"title":{"changed":false},"uuid":"fc0417ee-d5ed-4ad4-a2b8-c719331e5328"},{"annotations":{"changed":false},"answerUuids":{"changed":false},"createdAt":"2022-08-05T14:05:02.18Z","entityUuid":"6b3a2162-838a-482a-9fbb-d4df487c95fd","eventType":"EditQuestionEvent","expertUuids":{"changed":false},"parentUuid":"e3301b05-b02d-4c09-bb4b-7fb181414236","questionType":"OptionsQuestion","referenceUuids":{"changed":false},"requiredPhaseUuid":{"changed":false},"tagUuids":{"changed":false},"text":{"changed":true,"value":"separated from the actual resource they describe, but are nonetheless persistently linked via a GUPRI (linking metadata explicitly to the resource and vice versa, as described in FDOF specifications). Here we explicitly emphasize that implementation choice as crucial for a FAIR by design approach. The F3 principle states that any description of a digital resource must contain clearly and explicitly the identifier of that resource being described. For instance, the description of a computational workflow, should explicitly contain the identifier for that workflow in a manner that is unambiguous (well qualified, see Principle I3). This is especially important where the resource and its metadata are stored independently, but are nonetheless persistently linked, which is assumed to be the case by the GO FAIR Foundation. The purpose of this principle is twofold. First, it is perhaps trivial to say that a descriptor should explicitly say what resources it is describing; however, there is a second, less-obvious reason for this principle. Many digital objects (such as workflows, as mentioned above) have well-defined structures that may disallow the addition of new fields, including fields that could point to the metadata about that resource. Therefore, the only consistent way for both humans and machines to discover the metadata of a resource is through a search for the identifier of that resource. Thus, by requiring that a metadata descriptor contains the identifier of the thing being described, that identifier may then successfully be used as the search term to discover its metadata record. However, it should be clear that in many cases the identifier itself is not a regular search term. In fact the GO FAIR Foundation considers it good practice in FAIR to avoid semantic meaning in GUPRIs as these are be prone to change. That is why rich metadata are already defined in F2 of the guiding principles. When FAIR principle F3 mentions that the identifier of the object should be explicitly and clearly included in the object's metadata, our interpretation assumes \"explicit\" refers to the mere presence of the resources's identifier in the content of the metadata record while \"clear\" refers to having this identifier directly and unambiguously related to the metadata record by means of a known predicate. In previous experiments examining common usage, we have identified over 20 different ways that stakeholders sometimes use to declare which resource is being described by a given metadata record. This makes it very hard for humans and machines to, given a metadata record, identify which object this record describes.\n\nTo summarize, this question requests a FAIR Enabling Resource of type “metadata-data linking schema” which is a specification that provides a unique, persistent, (ideally) bi-directional, machine-actionable link between metadata and the data they describe."},"title":{"changed":false},"uuid":"083ed156-1e25-40f4-813e-1738d9fbf21c"},{"annotations":{"changed":false},"answerUuids":{"changed":false},"createdAt":"2022-08-05T14:05:06.15Z","entityUuid":"bca69e12-de5e-4798-aea8-2ed49d508b0f","eventType":"EditQuestionEvent","expertUuids":{"changed":false},"parentUuid":"e3301b05-b02d-4c09-bb4b-7fb181414236","questionType":"OptionsQuestion","referenceUuids":{"changed":false},"requiredPhaseUuid":{"changed":false},"tagUuids":{"changed":false},"text":{"changed":true,"value":"Principle F4 states that digital resources must be registered or indexed in a searchable resource (e.g., a search engine).

Note that the agent may be a machine working behind a firewall, if that agent has been permitted access. For fully mechanized access, this requires that the identifier (F1) follows a globally-accepted schema that is tied to a standardized, high-level communication protocol. FAIR, however, does not necessarily preclude non-mechanized access, only that the mechanism is so well described that a machine can identify the appropriate next course of action even if it should include human agents.  In the latter case, it is still necessary that the identifier (F1) be sufficient as a way of unambiguously indicating, to a non-automated agent, the record that is being requested.  The “standardized communication protocol” is critical here. Its purpose is to provide a predictable way for an agent to access a resource, regardless of whether the access to the content of the resource is open or restricted, and regardless of whether that access is automated or aided by human action (e.g., “send your request for access by email or telephone”).

A “qualified reference” is a reference to another resource (i.e., referencing that external resource's persistent identifier), in which the nature of the relationship is also clearly specified.  For instance, when multiple versions of a metadata file are available, it may be useful to provide links to prior or next versions using a named relation such as “prior version” or “next version” (using an appropriate community standard relationship that itself conforms to the FAIR principles). In the case of data, imagine a dataset that specifies the population of cities around the world. To be FAIR with respect to principle I3, the data could contain links to a resource containing city data (e.g., https://www.wikidata.org/  D. Vrandečić . Wikidata: A new platform for collaborative data collection. In: Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on World Wide Web, 2012, pp. 1063–1064. 10.1145/2187980.2188242), geographical and geospatial data, or other related domain resources that are generated by that city, so long as they are properly qualified references using meaningful, clearly-interpretable relationships. It is also important to note that many different metadata files (containers) being FAIR digital resources in themselves, can be pointing to the same “target” object (a data set or a workflow for instance).

However, the rationale behind principle F2 is to enable effective attribute-based search and query (findability), while the focus of R1 is to enable machines and humans to assess if the discovered resource is appropriate for intended reuse, given a specific task. For example, not all gene expression data for a given locus are relevant to a study of the effects of heat stress. While irrelevant data may be discovered by the agent's initial search (principle F2) for expression data about a given gene, here we address the ability to assess and filter the discovered data based on suitability-for-purpose. This reiterates the need for good data stewards  to consider not only high-level metadata facets, that will assist in generic search, but also to consider more detailed metadata that will provide much more “operational” instructions for re-use. In this setting, a wide variety of factors may be needed to determine whether a resource is suitable for inclusion in an analysis, and how to adequately process it. The term “plurality” is used to indicate that the metadata author should be as generous as possible, not narrowly presuming who the secondary consumers might be, and therefore provide as much metadata as possible to support the widest variety of use-cases and agent needs.

As can be seen herein, the FIP Wizard captures FIPs by means of a questionnaire that prompts a representative of the community (the Community Data Steward) to provide answers that explicitly profile the FAIR implementation approach of that community. FIPs are published by the FIP Wizard as FAIR (machine-readable) and Open data, which can then serve as a reference for practical FAIR data stewardship activities conducted by members of that community. FIP publication also encourages FIP reuse and repurposing by other communities, which saves time ‘reinventing the wheel’ and simultaneously drives convergence on FAIR implementation choices. Over time, FIPs will need to be revised to reflect the evolving needs of the community and the ongoing development of FAIR technologies. In short, the FIP Wizard helps to make FAIRification efforts more structured, better informed and overall more efficient.\n\nThe FIP Wizard has a number of features specifically supporting FIP creation: \n\n**Questionnaire**: The FIP questionnaire is augmented with explanations, per question, based on Jacobsen et al. FAIR Principles: Interpretations and Implementation Considerations. Data Intelligence 2020; 2 (1-2): 10–29, [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1162/dint_r_00024) and referencable at the [GO FAIR Foundation website](https://www.gofair.foundation/interpretation )\n\n**Navigation**: While creating the FIP, the questionnaire can be navigated using the navigation tool on the left side of the page. \n\n**Versioning**: The FIP Wizard has versioning that allows systematic revisions of completed FIPs over time which in turn can provide insight into FAIR-related technology trends. \n\n**Nanopublications**: The FIP Wizard makes use of a data format called nanopublications to capture FIPs as FAIR data (in this case, as FAIR Digital Objects). In some cases, it may be necessary to author original nanopublications to complete your FIP.  The FIP Wizard supports the creation of original nanopublications in Chapter VII, “Register a new resource as a nanopublication”.\n\nDetailed instructions for completing the FIP Wizard questionnaire can be found [here](https://osf.io/5ygzx).\n\nFIP Wizard team is composed of Barbara Magagna, Marek Suchanek, Tobias Kuhn, and Erik Schultes.

Some digital resources, such as data that have access restrictions based on ethical, legal or contractual constraints, require additional conditions/steps to be accessed. This often pertains to assuring that the access requester is indeed that requester (authentication), that the requester's profile and credentials match the access conditions of the resource (authorization), and that the intended use matches permitted use cases (e.g. for a particular  purpose only) (see also R1.1, where there are requirements to provide explicit documentation about who may use the data, and for what purposes). At the level of technical implementation, an additional authentication and authorization procedure must be specified, if it is not already defined by the protocol (see A1.1). A requester can be a human or a machine agent. In the latter case it is probably a proxy for a human or an organization to which the authentication and authorization protocol should be applied, in which case, the machine should be expected to present the appropriate credentials. The principle requires that a FAIR resource must provide such a protocol, but the protocol itself is not further specified. In practice, an Internet of FAIR Data and Services cannot function without implementing Authentication and Authorization Infrastructure, which includes AAI for machines and should thus be Ontology-based and machine actionable (see also Christopher Brewster, Barry Nouwt, Stephan Raaijmakers, Jack Verhoosel; Ontology-based Access Control for FAIR Data.

A “qualified reference” is a reference to another resource (i.e., referencing that external resource's persistent identifier), in which the nature of the relationship is also clearly specified.  For instance, when multiple versions of a metadata file are available, it may be useful to provide links to prior or next versions using a named relation such as “prior version” or “next version” (using an appropriate community standard relationship that itself conforms to the FAIR principles). In the case of data, imagine a dataset that specifies the population of cities around the world. To be FAIR with respect to principle I3, the data could contain links to a resource containing city data (e.g., https://www.wikidata.org/  D. Vrandečić . Wikidata: A new platform for collaborative data collection. In: Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on World Wide Web, 2012, pp. 1063–1064. 10.1145/2187980.2188242), geographical and geospatial data, or other related domain resources that are generated by that city, so long as they are properly qualified references using meaningful, clearly-interpretable relationships. It is also important to note that many different metadata files (containers) being FAIR digital resources in themselves, can be pointing to the same “target” object (a data set or a workflow for instance). For instance a FAIR Digital Object constructed as a nanopublication can have intrinsic metadata (“what is this”) and how was it created (provenance type metadata) as well as “secondary” metadata that are for instance created (separately and later in time) by reusers of a particular digital resource. These could all be metadata containers essentially describing the same digital resource from different perspectives. This principle therefore also relates to the good practice to clearly distinguish between metadata (files/containers) and the resources they describe.\n\nTo summarize, this question requests a FAIR Enabling Resource of type “semantic model” which is a specification that defines qualified relations between entities describing data or other digital objects using structured vocabularies.
